Hii friends,This project is developed with React Native Expo@51.0.4 and Nodejs@20.0.1

In the contemporary era, pet ownership has transcended mere companionship to become a deeply ingrained aspect of family life. As such, the demand for advanced tools and resources to streamline pet care management has burgeoned. Acknowledging this shift, we introduce a groundbreaking mobile application tailored explicitly for dog owners. Leveraging the synergies of React Native Expo, Node.js, and MongoDB, this innovative application epitomizes the apex of technological integration in the realm of pet care. By seamlessly amalgamating user-friendly interfaces with robust backend infrastructure, our application aims to revolutionize the way dog owners interact with and care for their beloved pets. This introduction delves into the significance of harnessing these technologies to develop a versatile, intuitive, and highly functional platform for dog care management, catering to the evolving needs and expectations of modern pet owners.
